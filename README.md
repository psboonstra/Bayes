- `Bayes.R` is all of the R code I used to create the presentation. 
It is the result of running `knitr::purl("Bayes.Rmd")`, where 
`Bayes.Rmd` is a markdown file (that I have not shared) that I wrote

- A script called `invert_pvalues.R` creates an exact confidence set based upon
inverting the corresponding p-value
